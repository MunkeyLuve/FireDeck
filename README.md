FIRE‑DECK • BUILDER’S REFERENCE (v1)
A condensed rule & template sheet for anyone designing cards, Aspects, or full Forges in the Fire‑Deck system. Copy‑paste freely.

1. CORE GAMEPLAY CONCEPTS
1.1 Ember Flow (formerly Momentum)
Stoke Step – Burn Brands from Grip: 1 Brand → 1 Ember (visible pool, max 10).


Ember carries over between turns.


Brands paid for leave play forever in the Ashen Hollow. If your Forge, Cinder Bed, and Grip are empty when you must draw/strike—you lose.


1.2 Eyes of the Fire
Inner‑Eye Brands rewrite global rules (economy, hand size, strike caps). Only one active at a time.


Outer‑Eye Brands warp the battlefield (keywords, chip damage, terrain hazards). Only one active at a time.


Each Forge may contain up to 5 total Eye Brands.


1.3 Strike Limit
Each living Aspect may Strike once per Combat Step unless an Eye/Brand says otherwise.


1.4 Grip Management
Hand (Grip) limit: 6 Brands. Draw Step refills to 6.


Stoke Step: burn any number of Brands for Ember.


1.5 Chains (combo engine)
Two or more Chain Brands ignited in the same Combat Step combine their base dmg then multiply (×2 by default; ×3 under Spark of Choice).


1.6 Victory
Reduce all four opposing Aspects’ Vital Sparks (HP) to 0.



2. TURN SEQUENCE
Draw Step – Refill Grip to 6.


Ignition Step – Spend Ember to cast Brands or activate Aspect skills.


Combat Step – Each Aspect may Strike once.


Stoke Step – Burn Brands for Ember, resolve lingering Scars/Blessings.

Totem Storm resets that terrain when it turns against you, while Verdant Overgrowth searches up the next battlefield twist.


Plenty of team healing/cleanse keeps the tribe standing, but two Chains give Coati teeth when the jungle bites back.

Passive — Song of the Forge
 Once per turn, when you play any Chain or Surge Brand, choose one effect:
 • Inspire – Heal 1 Spark on all allies.
 • Scorch – Deal 1 dmg to all enemies.


(The chosen effect stays “active” for the rest of the turn, powering several Brands above.)

Play rhythm
Cheap 0-Ember tools (Cinder Note, Flame Whisper) let you pick your song and start the tempo.


Chains escalate quickly, especially when Sovereign Crescendo doubles and retriggers the chorus.


Surges weave global buffs, board wipes, and a game-closing nova that flips the melody at will.


Build the deck around Aera’s dual beat—heal and burn in perfect counter-point—and let the Sovereign Flame set the whole battlefield singing.

Passive — Carry the Load
 Once each turn, when an ally would take damage, you may move up to 2 of that damage to Pathfinder. For every damage redirected, gain 1 Ember (max 2).



How Pathfinder Plays
Front-load the hurt: Your own Sparks become a resource—several Brands and Rally Charge grow stronger as Pathfinder bleeds.


Hit-redirect engine: Protective Stance, the passive, and Path Unwavering keep softer allies alive while charging Ember.


Navigation & tempo: Map the Course filters the Forge; Lead the Way + Chains unlock quick Ember bursts.


Team synergy: Works naturally beside Aera (global heals/burn) and Coati or Shaman (extra heals to offset self-wounds), anchoring the frontline while the rest strike from safety.


Forge the path, shoulder the weight, and let the tribe advance under your shield.
